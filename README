mooo.com t28.net some others from notes [?]
org.org

I suppose I should backorder these as well  :)

"wrap" afraid I guess...if this thing ever seems useful...

subscribe to afraid

webcasts? hmm....
those alternatives perhaps? ...

get back feedback from people before go live? 

offer them free email somehow? nah, maybe show them how to setup free email for their subdomains though :)


chickenkiller crabdance, ignorelist.com jumpingcrab, strangled.net twilightparadox.com (also have a full list for them, these at top LOL).
or if they're very popular, backorder them? (don't need to back order them, apparently they're domains owned by afraid.org admin)

start a wiki page "add yourself to this list" also one for "cool domain names" whoa deja vu
